  # Fix RLS policies for budgets table - Complete Solution

  This migration completely resets and fixes the RLS policies for the budgets table
  to allow authenticated users to perform all CRUD operations.

  1. Security Changes
    - Ensure RLS is enabled
    - Drop all existing policies completely
    - Create simple, permissive policies for authenticated users
    - Grant necessary permissions to authenticated role

    );

CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_full_access"
